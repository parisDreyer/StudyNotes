binary search tree
    - at any time left < top, left < right and top-right < bottom


    anything on a left branch cannot be greater than the topmost root node
        - but anything on the right branch of a root's left has to be greater than it's parent

    anything on the right branch of a root has to be greater than the root and greter than it's parent

   EXAMPLE
     17
   /    \
  15     22
  / \      \
 10  16     47
 /\    \
9  12  16.5
        /
       16.25



- Other types of searchtree datastructures include: RedBlack trees

NB binary search trees are only good bigO if the tree is balanced


- if a tree is balanced -- the depth of left and right at the root will differ by at most 1

___
Traversals (inorder preorder, postorder)
    - in order traversals
        - left to right, top to bottom
