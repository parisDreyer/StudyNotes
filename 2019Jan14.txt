System Design
Vertical Scaling - add more memory, cpu, harddrive to existing host
Horizontal Scaling - add another host
    - Horizontal is cheaper but adds distributed system challenges


CAP theorem
-Consistency
    - read has most recent write
-Availability
    - you will get a response, might not be most recent write
-Partion Tolerance
    - between two nodes you might be dropping network packets

ACID vs BASE
    Acid:
    Base:

Partitioning / Sharding Data
    - consistent hashing

Optimistic Vs Pessimistic Locking

Strong Vs Eventual Consistency
    strong - reads always see latest write
    eventual - reads eventually see some write

SQL
    - more consistend
NoSQL
    - scales better, has higher availability, but less consistent
    -document based nosql
    -graph based nosql

Caching
    - used to speed up a request
    - every node does its own caching

DataCenters, Racks, Hosts
    - datacenters have racks, racks have hosts
    - latency between talking cross-racks or cross-hosts
    - cpu, memory, hard-drive, network bandwidth
        - all limited, have to work around hardware latencies
    - random vs sequential read/write on disk


http vs http2 vs websockets
    http: request reply architecture between client and server
    http2: multiple request per single connection
    websocket: fully bidirectional connection between client and server

TCP/IP model

IPV4 vs IPV6

TCP vs UDP
    tcp: email, reliable but slow
    udp: streaming, unreliable but fast

DNS lookup

HTTPs & TLS
    tls: transport layer security
        - secures communication between client and server
            - in terms of privacy and data security

Public Key infrastructure & Certificate of Authority

Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption
    assymetric: computationaly more expensive (public private key encryption)
    symmetric: aees

Load Balancer -> L4 vs L7
    - round robin basis or other
    - L4 counts in destination and addresses
    - L7 uses http uri to do load balancing (more commonly used)

CDN & Edge
    cdn: content delivery network
    edge: processing close to end user
            - dedicated network from edge to data center

Bloom Filters & Count-min Sketch
    Bloom Figures: decide if element is member of set or not
        - has false positive bet never false negative
    Count-min Sketch: counts frequency of events

Paxos Consensus Over distributed Hosts
    -e.g. leader election

Design Patterns & Object oriented Design
    Design Patterns:factory methods, singletons
    oop: abstractions, inheritence

Virtual Machines & Containers
    container: application and dependencies in isolated environment

Publisher-Subscriber, Queue
    - Customer facing requests should not be directly exposed to
        a publisher-subscriber system
Map Reduce
    - Distributed and parallel processing of big data
    - Map is sifting and sorting the data
    - reduce is summarizing the data

Multi-Threading, Concurrency, Locks, Synchronization, CAS



++++


Cassandra
    - wide column highly scalable database
    - time series data
    - eventual and strong consistency
    - consistent hashing to shard data
    - gossiping to keep nodes informed about structure

MONGOdb / CouchBase
    - ACID properties
    - Scales well

MYsql
    - master - slave architecture
    - ACID Architecture
    - scales well

Memcached
    - distributed cache
    - fast key-value storage

Redis
    - distributed cache
    - key-value storage
    - can be set up as a cluster
    - flush data on harddrive

A note on distributed cache systems:
    - distributed cache systems should never be the single source of truth
    - limited amount of data, limited by amount of memory on host

Zookeeper
    - centralized configuration management tool
    - leader election, distributed locking
    - scales well for reads but not for writes
    - keeps all data in memory but can't store much data in zookeeper
    - good for small amount of data held in memory

Kafka
    - fault tolerant highly available queue
    - uses publisher subscriber
    - good for streaming
    - delivers message once
        - keeps messages in partition on topic until ready to send

NGINX, HAProxy
    - efficient load balancer
    - manages 100000s of connections from client from single instance

Solr, Elastic Search
    - source platform
    - full text search

Blobstore like Amargon 53
    - good for big picture file hosting

Docker
    - cloud storage container system
    Tools to manage
        - Kubernetes
        - mesos

Hadoop / Spark
    - Map-Reduce parallel processing of data
    - HDFS
