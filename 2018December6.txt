! in swift

you wrap optional variables by declaring them with ?
e.g:
----------------------
var john: Person?
----------------------

then 
----------------------
john!
----------------------
the exclamation mark unwraps the value into either nil or a person object
whereas if you didn't unwrap the value then you would have an optional variable object

NB
to create associations between between .xib elements you ctrl click + drag the element you want to associate with the other element
This ctrl++click&drag is how to use the UI to align one element relative to a parent element.
