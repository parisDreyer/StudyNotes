- some notes on ms azure luis model chatbot



Below is an explanation of the "Waterfall Method" as implemented
by MS Azure's LUIS Chatbot framework:
______________________________________
the luis chatbot is an intent/sentiment/language recognizer
    - you pass in user text input and the LUIS recogniser responds with a
    machine-learning model likelihood that that text belongs to a certain
    developer assigned intent. It seems okay for simple cases though I would want to customize it
    heavily for specific requirements
    - You pass in the 'Intents' as text parameters that the luis recognizer
    matches user text to.
        - e.g. if you have made the intents( "RAINING_PROMPT" and "WALKING_PROMPT")
        one of those intents is decided with a probability score by the luis recognizer
    
    With the intent decided then the app advances to functions that are
    developer defined responses for a specific intent
