^ the above is a great place to make quick comic book style sketches
that can be used for contemporary super-simple mobile games.


I think the advantage to having a simple and unique style for a game
is that you can continually develop extensions to the game and other game
developer knockoffs cannot be made at a rate that keeps up with yours

Also unique art is harder to get away with plagerizing maybe?
