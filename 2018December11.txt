HI <name>, hope you’re well. I see you’re now at <company>. 
I’d love to know more about the company as I’m a <student at AA> and I’m looking for a 
Frontend Developer position. Can we get on a call next week to discuss your hiring needs?



Sample letter to send to people in your social network:

Hi (name),

Hope you're well and getting ready for the holidays. 
If you recall, we met at (place and time) and I thought to reconnect with you. 
I'm currently searching for work as a software developer, and I'm researching companies. I see you are a developer at (company).

I'd love the chance to learn more about why you chose this particular company, what the culture is like there, 
and your own journey to becoming a developer.
Your insight will be extremely valuable for me.

Would you be open to a 15-20 minute call or google hangout before the holidays? I promise not to take up much of your time, 
as I'm sure you're busy.

Thank you so much and look forward to hearing from you.

position that I'd be a fit for at (company), would you be an open to taking a look at my resume? 
Your feedback would be very valuable.
