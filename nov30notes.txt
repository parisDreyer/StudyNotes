    Maximum Number Of Rows In A Table

    The theoretical maximum number of rows in a table is 264 
    (18446744073709551616 or about 1.8e+19). This limit is unreachable 
    since the maximum database size of 140 terabytes will be reached first. 
    A 140 terabytes database can hold no more than approximately 1e+13 rows, 
    and then only if there are no indices and if each row contains very little 
    data.
