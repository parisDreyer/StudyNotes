good though experiment:

How to detect if someone is using a bot that repeatedly makes requests (over 100,000) through
different virtual private networks (vpns) and ip addresses to watch Youtube videos
    -this has been done by youtube channel owners to raise the number of views (and thus commercial value)
    of their channels!
