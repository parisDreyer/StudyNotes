negotiations
upside

leverage for future raises & negotiations

downsides (rare)
offer withdrawn (only happens 2 times out of 80*8*3 people)
might expect more of you
might think you are greedy


- usually if they decline
    - they still offer at lower rate

    
- if you take a job at 70k
    - 25k for rent
    - 25k for appacademy
    -that leaves 20k for food and transit
        - not enough!

- when you are at the point of negotiations
    -12 days of recruiter time per person
    - by the time they are negotiating with you they are exhausted
        - they need people

- cost of emplying one engineer
    - if your salary is 100k
    - taxes + materials adds 85k

- interview process costs 80k

What you can get on average when appacademy students negotiate
    - 5 to 15k more
    - compensation distribution by city: 110-115k
        - some will get 90k -> that's okay

Companies don't benefit from being stubborn
    - 90% of negotiations turn into more money
        - the rest of the time the company stays firm



What to do when you get a call with an offer
    -First talk to your coach
    - tell every other company you applied to you have an offer
    - ask for more time
        - "this is a huge life decision, I have to talk it over with some family"
        - companies will give you a week or so
    - get additional info about position before negiating salary
    - if you get more than one offer only go back and forth twice max
    - offer to forego other offers for +25k signing bonus

3 Rules of Navigating Negotiations
    1.
    - Never give a salary at the start
        - don't pop off a number if you don't have to
        - once you get to negotiations you're the one they want
    - don't give away the first number
        -my priority is a copmany that offers "mentorship/etc"
    - "For me it is really about the culture, fit and position.
        Right now may be a little early for this discussion
        However, when we do get there, I will be looking at Glassdoor and the local market and I am sure
        we will find something that will be a win-win for everyone"

        - if they then ask you "okay but give us a number"
            - say "based on my reading on Glassdoor and the marketplace i'm looking for something in the 120 Range
    - Kiss up at the end (invite them into a dialogue): Then say "for me it's really about culture and fit and I'm sure we'll find something that will work best for both of us"
    2.
    - get things in writing (email): 
    - say: i really like the people and position seems like a great fit
    - don't negotiate over the phone
    - if you get caught up in the negotiation, repeat the number or be silent for a second
    - ask "can i tell you my ideal number ( only if you have to)
    - Research market rates and company before going in
    
    - A good response at an onsight would be "you know what, I'm really happy with this company and the culture and I'm sure we'll find something that's a win-win for both of us"

    Early:
        - Right now i think it is early on the process to discuss this
    Onsite:
        - for me it is about culture and fit. I am confident you will provide a fair and competitive offer based on what is happening here in the local market
        - 90% of companies expect this
    Need a Number:
        - Based on what I am seeing on Glassdoor and the marketplace I am looking at the $XXX range. However I am very excited about your company and what you are doing here and i am confident we can find something that will work for all o us.

    We are new software developers and that is true
        - but we do have background before appacademy
            - are background is valuable
        - if dealing with tech recruiter when they ask for a number
            - if it's early then say it's too early to talk
            - if they then make you then give a number (115)

    - some companies don't negotiate -- uber's policy is they don't negotiate
    - also negotiate working from home three days a week or commuter benefits
    - negotiate vacation times if not giving money

    What type of jobs should we apply for?
        - everything
        - 40 applications a week
            - at least 25 through clearbit
            - if the company is not on glassdoor, research similar companies

Inside vs outside recruiters
    - e.g. Hired: TripleByte
        -paid recruiters
        - behooves them to get you higher salary because they get percentage
        - if you want to go on it's great -frontend test
    

Equity
    - get the salary to start
    - salary guaranteed equity is not
    - startup even 100k shares it's a crapshoot
    - don't forget you will have a performance review--at that point negotiate for more equity
    - ask what the runway is -- how far ahead can you afford me?
        - ask "what's your current runway"

negotiate for
    -401k
    -benefits
    - equity
    - roles, responsibilities, upward mobility, mentorship
    - misc: parking, lunches, gym memberships, etc
    - vacation
    - RSUs
    - Stock options

- get a financial planner


- no discuss salary without offer first
- discuss all non salary items first
- when you get offer make sure you have 2-3 weeks to decide
- don't negotiate over phone
- talk with your coach



- Once you get hired - take one or two weeks off to refresh before walking onto the job
    - if they need somebody tuesday that's up to you
