Description:
Understanding where we are and what is around us shapes our 
behavior and our interactions with people and objects. Yet 
most mobile devices today assume that the boundaries of the 
world end at the boundaries of the screen. Project Tango is a 
platform integrating custom sensors and software that allow 
developers to explore new user experiences enabled by 3D 
tracking and perception. Applications include navigating 
through indoors spaces, measuring your environment, playing 
3D games around your home, and being able to walk through 
immersive experiences. Come join us on this journey.
